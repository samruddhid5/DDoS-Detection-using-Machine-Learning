# DDoS-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning models. The notebook implements several classification techniques to identify DDoS attacks in network traffic data.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
- Preprocess network traffic data from the **SDN-DDOS Dataset**.
- Implement and train machine learning models to detect DDoS attacks in real-time.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **SDN-DDOS Dataset** available on Mendeley. It contains various types of DDoS attacks (ICMP, TCP, UDP) and normal traffic data.
- **Download the dataset**: [SDN-DDOS Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hkjbp67rsc/1)
- The dataset was cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets for the evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
