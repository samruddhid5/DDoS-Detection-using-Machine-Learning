# DDoS-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning models. The notebook implements several classification techniques to identify DDoS attacks in network traffic data.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
- Preprocess network traffic data for analysis.
- Implement and evaluate machine learning models to detect DDoS attacks.
- Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
